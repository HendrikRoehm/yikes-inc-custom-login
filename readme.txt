Quickly generate custom front-end login, register, password reset and account profile forms for a WordPress site.

Custom WP Login replaces the WordPress login flow with custom pages. It allows you have a complete user registration and login experience on the public-facing pages of your WordPress site. This is useful for sites who want to use WordPress' built-in users functionality, but only want to keep users on the front-end of the site and not in the WordPress dashboard.

* Customize the Login Page, with a logo, background, image, form colors and more!
* Add reCaptcha to the Login form.
* Customize the welcome email users receive after they register.
